## Adapted Scenes
<details>

Scene 1: Getting Groceries (Scrapped: Stealing Food From Farm)
 
> The first phase is based on the scene where Setsuko and Seita go and purchase rice from the store after moving in with their Aunt. I decided to adapt this instead of the scene where Seita steals food from farmers due to time constraints, and as a way to differentiate between the pre-raid and post-raid world. In Grave of the Fireflies, the plot builds from Seita and Setsuko enjoying life to resorting to theivery while on the clutches of death, which was hard for me to pull off properly in such a short period of time. So I decided to take a more light-hearted and goofy approach instead, which I think turned out well.

Scene 2: Air Raid 
> This is one of the most iconic scenes from the movie, so I knew it had to go in from the start. I struggled with the art direction for this scene since trying to create active destruction in games is very hard to do in a convincing way, but all my doubt went away as soon as I added Camera Shake to the explosions. Glory to Camera Shake 🙏🙏🙏

Scene 3: Fireflies in Cave (Or Fireflies in General)
> This scene is based off of the time where Setsuko and Seita go look for fireflies, and let them all loose in their cave. As soon I saw this scene, I knew it was gonna be my core pillar and foundation due to how beautiful it was. If I had more time, I would have added lighting to the whole map and went all out, but I think only having it in the end acts as a good reward for the player.

### Quests and Cutscenes
Before this I have always wondered how cutscenes and quests were implemented into games, since at first glance it seemed like it would be very hard to manage so many quests and make sure they all work with each other properly. But then I found this lab in Phaser that uses a function array that can chain into each other, and that made it very easy. The first scenes I created though have the array baked into the Scene file itself which looks very messy, but later on I separated them and it turned out well!

### Minigames
Ok, so I could not think of way of not making this adaptation a walking simulator, and I hate walking simulators, so what better way to spice it up than with minigames! 🎆🎆🎆 I love Mario Party and have always wanted to create a set of minigames, so I had a lot of fun adding them to FireFlies. There is a ranking system as well in the Post-Game minigames, so you can try and set the highest scores possible! (which are also saved to local storage!)

### Lighting
I hate Phaser's Lighting system. I hate that I have to write `.setPipeline('Light2D')` after every single game object. I hate creating normal maps. I hate that there was not a single search result on Google on how to create a Light prefab in Phaser. 

But it was all worth it in the end! The Cave Scene turned out amazing; it took a lot of effort and fine tuning, but it really made a difference in how good it looked. I will definitely make an effort to add lighting to any other game I create. 

Ok that is all, hope you enjoyed my game!
